# CUDA Learning Kernels

This repository records my learning process of CUDA kernel development,
from naive implementations to optimized versions, with detailed performance
analysis using Nsight Compute (ncu).

## Goals
- Implement common CUDA kernels from scratch
- Track naive → optimized evolution
- Analyze performance bottlenecks with ncu
- Build reproducible benchmarks and correctness checks

## Planned Kernels
- Element-wise (vector add)
- Transpose
- Reduce
- MatMul
- Softmax
- RMSNorm
- Flash Attention
